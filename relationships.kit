                    There are several exercises within the Intensive Journal method that can help you develop insights and perspectives about a relationship you have with someone whom you know well. This person has an inner importance to you such as a family member or close friend.
                  </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Apply Progoff’s inner dialogue process to enable you to walk in the shoes of another person to realize how their life experiences can influence their perspective and actions. This key step can lead to a more authentic communication and understanding.</li>
                <li>Use the Intensive Journal exercises helps you articulate and clarify your thoughts about that person.</li>
                <li>
                  Become more comfortable discussing your feelings after having expressed them in our written exercises.
                </li>
                <li>
                  View the relationship from different vantagepoints. For example, employ other inner dialogue exercises to connect with the relationship (e.g. marriage) itself to understand its nature, issues, and trends.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use the integrative techniques of the method to understand how other areas of your life can impact a personal relationship.
                </li>
                <li>
                Use the inner dialogue exercises to work through the bereavement process. Dr. Progoff was fond of quoting: “Death ends a life, but it does not end a relationship.”* You can deepen your relationship, gain peace and understanding, even with those who are deceased.
                </li>
                <li>
                View the relationship within the context of your entire life using Progoff’s “whole life process.”
                </li>
                <li>
                Use the insights about the relationship to take next steps in your life. You can heal old wounds, bring greater harmony, and reduce interfamily tension.
                </li>
                <li>
                Revisit and deepen your understanding of the relationship as you work in the Intensive Journal method over time.
                </li>
              </ul>
