                  "The Intensive Journal program and EfM both deeply trust the individual experience and the present
              moment to reveal life-forming meaning. These programs aid participants in the articulation of the meaning
              that anchors their lives, clarifies their call to live their faith in the world, and supports them in the work of
              ministry. The Intensive Journal method offers individuals a broadened understanding of the depths within,
              while EfM offers participants a committed community in which to broaden understanding of life perspectives
              in the greater world."

                <blockquote>
                  "For four decades, I have held both the Intensive Journal method and Education for Ministry program in an
              ongoing, intimate dialogue in my participation in meaning and truth. The approach to inner work which
              founder Ira Progoff PhD has chosen for the Intensive Journal method has allowed me to know the full
              mystery of being human experientially in a progressively deepening way. The Education for Ministry
              Program has helped me place my story within the story of the People of God. Together the two programs
              have been the primary means by which I have been formed as a person in relationship with the Holy."
