      system for achieving the deeper listening that
      brings a sense of God's presence, peace and
      will....on the way to our deeper self...that
      deeper awareness, and the power for Godly
      living that flows from it, is a practical way of
      speaking of the Intensive Journal method....Of
      all the spiritual disciplines that I have used
      across the years, this one has been the most
      dependable in keeping me on track, energized
      and focused."<sup>1</sup>

                      What appears on the surface to be an inner dialogue between myself and contents of my past is, from the
                  perspective of faith, a dialogue in which I listen to God speaking to me from within my own life / experience.
                  The Intensive Journal structure is a vehicle for such interior dialogue, which is a form of prayer.

                  "...The object of each individual life / process is to establish and maintain contact with the God of all. The
                  procedure of moving toward that objective is the practice of a spirituality of experience. It is my position that
                  Ira Progoff's Intensive Journal method is a link between inner renewal and the outer life ....It is an introduction
                  to a spirituality of experience.""<sup>1</sup>

excellent complement to centering prayer/contemplative
practice in which I have practiced for over 20 years. It
provides many practical exercises for conducting the deep
inner work for connecting with my true self and experiencing God’s presence within.

Conducted in a quiet reflective atmosphere, the Intensive
Journal method is compatible with our practices in
centering prayer/contemplative practice, a companion on
my lifelong journey of self-discovery and spiritual growth.
I strongly encourage you to attend these workshops."
