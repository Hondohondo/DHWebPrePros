                  <p>
                  Being a member of the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender) community in today's society can result in a complex set of emotions and pressures. Societal norms can result in a lack of self-esteem, repression of thoughts and life style, and an internalized shame that leads to a lack of connection with one's true identity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                The Intensive Journal workshop provides LGBT participants with a sanctuary from which to work through their most intimate feelings in a safe, supportive and non-judgmental environment.  Using the Intensive Journal method is an ongoing process of growth, which participants may choose to continue after the workshop experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                Our method provides a practical way for members of the LGBT community to foster greater self-acceptance, and to embrace their sexuality as they connect with their unique self. The Intensive Journal method is an energizing process that enables participants to connect with different aspects of their lives that may have been repressed or denied. Through this process, a healthier and more meaningful life can ensue.
