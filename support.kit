                <blockquote>
                  "Each person has the potentiality for accessing their inner being to experience a profound transformation within themselves."
                </blockquote>
                <p class="right-span">Dr. Ira Progoff</p>

                  <p>
                   Dr. Progoff had great faith in the potential of each person, regardless of their background, to discover within themselves the resources to develop their lives.
                   In the 1960's he carried out this faith by creating the Intensive Journal method, providing an accessible self-development program for the average person at a time when few existed.
                    Designed to be used by individuals of any educational or social background, the Intensive Journal method has since become recognized for its enduring effectiveness and value.
                  </p>


                  <p>
                    Together with our dedicated staff and cadre of leaders, I am committed to fulfilling my father's vision for
                     developing the Intensive Journal method. Your contribution would help fund:

                  <h6>A Powerful Tool for Social Change</h6>

                  <p>
                  The Intensive Journal method has great potential for social
