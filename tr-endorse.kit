            "In life, crises do happen, and when an extreme trauma occurred in my life, the Intensive Journal process was most significant in helping me to maintain balance and unravel some destructive painful confusion...At times when I experienced 'body flashbacks' of pain or trauma, dialogues [Intensive Journal exercises] allowed me to gain meaning and integration. Therapists often say, 'If you can feel it, you can heal it', and with that I kept moving forward in my recovery process using the method."D Mathers

"[After being struck by a semi-truck], the processes I learned [in the Intensive Journal workshop] have enabled me to address issues I had previously been unable to define, let alone to explore. I am learning to integrate the events in my life as part of a continuous journey instead of viewing them as circumscribed by the accident."
