                "The Intensive Journal method was an integral part of my recovery. The organization of the Intensive Journal workbook allowed me to pull from inaccessible parts of my life and bring them into a synthesis that enabled me to make better life-affirming decisions. It helped me to be more in control of my life. Through these workshops, I was empowered to make a career change to be a substance abuse professional. The Intensive Journal method has helped me deal with life's adversity and work through transitions. I am immersed in a positive addiction to the Progoffâ„¢ method and I highly recommend the Intensive Journal method to substance abuse professionals."

            <br class="u-margin-bottom-small">  1) a nonjudgmental way to approach the events and movements in one's life;
            <br>  2) a gentle and compassionate approach to sensitive personal aspects of one's life that are often colored by shame, ambivalence, confusion;
            <br>  3) a way to bring hope as insights from journal entries can suggest a way "out" and "through" painful and toxic situations of addiction;
              4) a sense of the movement of one's life, which is core to the Intensive Journal process, that empowers an individual who can feel "stuck" in addiction to bring hope and vitality to their lives."
