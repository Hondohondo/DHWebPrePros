                  <p>
                    The <em>Progoff</em>&trade; methodology provides you with an integrated system of writing exercises
    for personal and spiritual growth that are conducted in a reflective meditative setting.
    Our program is an excellent complementary resource to your practice of mindfulness,
    providing you with new ways to explore your life experiences with curiosity while dropping
    assumptions for fresh perspectives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
              The <em>Intensive Journal</em> program is a practical tool to connect with your inner process about such areas as personal relationships, body and health, and meaning in life.  Using writing as a means for accessing personal experiences and emotions, the deepening atmosphere and unique structure of the <em>Intensive Journal</em> exercises creates the opportunity for profound inner experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At our workshops, you work in total privacy and silence as our certified instructors guide you
        step-by-step through each exercise. Adopting  an accepting, non-judgmental approach, you
        are receptive to all thoughts and feelings as you deepen your journey to connect with the broad
        scope of your life.  Similarly, you employ a non-analytical method to bypass preconceived and circular ways of thinking to connect with your true self.
                  </p>

                    Finding Meaning in Life
                  </h6>
                  <blockquote>
                  "The meaning of life cannot be told; it has to happen to a person.<sup>1</sup> ..."There is no use in one person attempting to tell another person what the meaning of life is. It involves too intimate an awareness.  A major part of the meaning of life is contained in the very process of discovering it.  It is an ongoing experience of growth that involves a deepening of contact with reality."<sup>2</sup>
