The workshop helped me access my inner wisdom, through a series of writing exercises that were conducted in a meditative setting of privacy. Perhaps most important, I continue to use my practice as a discernment tool in my life, important at any stage of life. The Spirit simply seems to lead as I follow this insightful process."

Most ministers (clergy, pastors, etc.) readily agree that finding time for their own soul-searching is nearly impossible. They rarely have nearby friends and confidants for sharing this work. In addition, who needs the structure and the time for soul searching more than ministers? After five years as a solo pastor, I found my way to an Intensive Journal workshop. Iâ€™ve used the process ever since. Once a person learns how to use the Intensive Journal method, it is always as close as some quiet time and pen and paper. I have been able to check in with myself, my relationships, my career, and my values. Now, in retirement, I am using the process to explore opportunities not yet pursued, creative work I had put aside, and relationships I want to nurture.
