(Regarding a Progoff workshop at the Abbey of Gestsemani:) "Dr. Progoff's method is understandably, then, nonanalytic and non-diagnostic in its approach, as well as integrative and so therapeutic in its purpose....In the light of Dr. Progoff's remarks...on the use of Eastern techniques in the West,...Thomas Merton seems to have voiced somewhat similar views shortly before his death...he had come to realize that the East held nothing for him that he could not have found or did not already have, essentially, in his own tradition and vocation..."

"...Ira Progoff's Intensive Journal Method is just such a link between inner renewal and the outer life and ministry of the priest. In the group setting the [Intensive Journal] workshop is a kind of silent retreat. In practice afterward, it appears to me as a form of prayer, a way for God to address us through the medium of our own experience. It is an introduction to a spirituality of experience."

"The Intensive Journal program is an instrument which lends itself to the discovery of the real presence of God in one's own personal life story. The content of the program is the content of the life of the Journal-writer; hence it is through the life of the Journal-writer that Christian faith may enter into the individual's use of the Intensive Journal exercises."
