      "The Intensive Journal method is a wonderful process for helping to integrate the spiritual, psychological and emotional components of your life. The process can help you work through issues such as the 'unfinished business' of dealing with the death of a relative, as well as figuring out the next steps in life. It makes a difference to get repetitive thoughts out of your head and onto paper where there is enough distance to look at them and learn from them."

I am grateful for its structure, which makes it natural to review my past entries and envision new directions. I treasure it for the safe container it provides to enter my private and tentative thoughts and feelings. It is thoroughly grounded in the present-day here and now, thus is valuable for anyone interested in personal growth."
