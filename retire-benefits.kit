                  The Intensive Journal method provides practical ways to develop your life in retirement.
                  </p>

                  <h6>Describe your transition to retirement</h6>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                       Deal creatively with change. Retirement can bring great change in many ways: your daily routine, how you relate to and impact others; financial concerns; priorities and interests.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                       Describe each of these areas that comprise this new phase of your life as you move into your new reality.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                  <h6 class="u-margin-top-small"> Explore and develop interests</h6>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                       Review the rich history of your life to discover missed or deferred opportunities. Uncover and explore interests, talents and possible projects that may be ripe for development now that you are retired.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                  <h6 class="u-margin-top-small"> Define and clarify your priorities and values</h6>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                       Define your priorities and values. Notice how they may have changed and the implications for each area of your life.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                       Answer the question: what brings you meaning?
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  <h6 class="u-margin-top-small"> Connect with body and health Issues</h6>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                      Develop a deeper understanding of the aging process. The body can be a rich source of wisdom in many areas of our life that can lead to changes in our behavior and life style.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                  <h6 class="u-margin-top-small"> Deepen your connection to personal relationships</h6>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                    Explore and perhaps enhance family relationships, which can be an important part of a meaningful retirement.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  <h6 class="u-margin-top-small">Define your life style</h6>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                    Adapt your daily routines and activities in response to the sea change of retirement. What life style do you want to achieve the objectives of your retirement?
                      </li>
                    </ul>
