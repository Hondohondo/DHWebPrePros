                  <strong>*</strong> Depression may be caused by a variety of factors, whether physical (i.e. chemical imbalance) or mental.  The <em>Progoff</em> methodology is intended for use by certain individuals who may have depression that has been caused at least in part by underlying issues in their lives. This brochure is addressed to health care professionals treating clients with depression as a component of their diagnosis.
