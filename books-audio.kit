                  <h1>Entrance Meditationâ„¢ Series  (Three meditations: $40)</h1>
                  <!-- <h6>A Different Form of Meditation</h6> -->
                  <p>
                    The Entrance Meditation series, rich in metaphors from nature and wisdom figures, takes us on an inward path that is gentle, profound, and free from religious doctrine.  Each of the three audios consists of eight separate meditations, which are self-contained units and may be used individually, or one can follow the sequence of each audio as the theme is developed through a full cycle of experiences.  They take you inward and then outward after the meditative experience.

Moving downward into our well, the inner depths of our self, we explore inner experiences, images and feelings. Our jumbled life experiences, the muddy waters of our lives, settle and become clear in the silence. New truths and symbols present themselves. From deep in our well, we are led into the underground stream, the timeless waters of eternity, to feel the presence of others.</td>
