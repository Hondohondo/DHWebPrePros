                      "The Intensive Journal method has been an invaluable benefit to me in developing my professional life, providing a place and a practice for reflecting on my career in the context of my whole life, bringing balance when
            responsibilities threatened to become all-consuming, and serving as an antidote to burn-out. It has provided
            techniques to navigate work-place conflicts; consider the pros and cons of career changes; and perceive the
            deeper meaning of my work and its social value. Without this marvelous tool, my life would not have the depth
            and richness the Intensive Journal process has provided—and continues to provide—as a life-long enhancement
            for working and living well."</blockquote>

  of experience in the field. Learning the Intensive Journal method has given me an indispensable tool for processing, and ultimately appreciating, how seemingly disparate interests and passions have woven together throughout my life to manifest in the unique ways that they have, including becoming an editor in the field of neurology.</blockquote>

                    "Through my work in the Intensive Journal process, I have gained a greater sense of peace and even awe about
    the arc of my professional life in the context of my life as a whole. The Intensive Journal method has helped me
    achieve clearer insight into the value to both myself and to the larger world that my career path in medical
    publishing has fostered. It has helped me better appreciate the ways my work contributes value to the medical
    community and ultimately has positive impact on patient care."
